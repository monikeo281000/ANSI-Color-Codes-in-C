# ANSI-Color-Codes-in-C
 This file defines constants and functions for adding ANSI color codes to C terminal output. It provides a simple way to colorize text printed to the console without needing to manually insert escape sequences.

<h3>Key aspects:</h3>

Constants define all common ANSI color codes for text styling.

Functions allow setting colors in a standardized way for print statements.

Portable across POSIX systems - utilizes widely supported ANSI escape codes.

Rather than a full-fledged API, this file encapsulates common color codes and offers a basic interface for coloring console text from C programs. Inclusion provides an easy means to dynamically set styles without low-level escape code handling.

Ideal for basic terminal output highlighting. The provided constants and functions standardize color use without deep library dependencies.
